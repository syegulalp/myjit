# TODO
* signed/unsigned behaviors
* iterator (see above)
* * `range` function
  * iterator object
    * objects and bound methods
      * ability to mangle names for things
        * special name mangling decorator
          * store items to mangle in dict, reference by object
          * implement name mangling
        * `exec()` function calls a mangled function with arguments passed
* `gep()`
* `ref()`, `deref()`
  * the Python versions of these operate on their Py object counterparts if possible
* convert to loadable C modules, obviate need for interface?
* programmatic generation of tests
